# Lighter Than Fast: Unknow Within

"Programmation nécessaire" project; Université de Lorraine, 2017.

This repo will contain the source for a C program, aiming to be a terminal game inspired by Faster Than Light.

## Goals
- Efficient memory management
- Allow to add and modify content easily through text files
- Compatibility with terminals of different sizes

## Non-Goals
- Windows compatibility (we'll try to support it as much as we can but won't struggle if that involves code changes)
- Relying too much on FTL: we're driven towards spaceships combats and ressources management, and the way we see it might evolve through time

## Optional (if meets deadlines)
- Use `ncurses` for interface
